# Movie Mystique

This is a web app that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API, place reviews on movies, and see movies ranked based on all the submitted reviews.  Users can search for movies by title or keyword, and view movie details such as ratings, genres, actors, and plot. Users can also write their own reviews and ratings for any movie, and see other users’ reviews and ratings.  This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Axios, Firebase, and Bootstrap.

## How to use

To use this app, simply visit the deployed link [here](https://movie-review-navy.vercel.app/).  You can use the search bar on the Explore page to find movies by keyword, and the search bar on the Specific page to find movies by title.  

Once you have found the movie you were looking for you can leave a review, rating it from 1 to 5 stars and writing your comments. You can also see other users’ reviews and ratings for that movie if there is any.

Going to the Ranking page will return you the top reviewed, most reviewed, and the worst reviewed movies calculated using all of the submitted reviews.
